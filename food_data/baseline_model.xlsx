every household in russia will have their own recipe for shashlyk. mine is developed via years of experimentation and is shown to produce good results even if you are not a dominating russian male :)

shaslyk can be made of any meat, as well as from chicken and fish, but my  favorite is pork shashlyk. if prepared correctly, it will produce the most succulent, juicy and tender pieces of meat. it must be cooked on a grill and ideally a wood or coal-burning version, as the smoky flavor is a quintessential element of shashlyk's taste. as for the meat, my favorite is fatty country ribs, but center loin roast or tenderloin will work too.","['pork', 'onions', 'red wine vinegar', 'pomegranate juice', 'salt and black pepper', 'mayonnaise']",5.0,12.016283032368616,russian,russian
