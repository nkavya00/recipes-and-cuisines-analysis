# Analyzing Recipes and Cuisines 
#### Analysis of cuisines and other factors from a large recipes dataset

## Introduction

Cooking is not just a necessity but a universal language that bridges cultures and traditions. In the age of globalization, understanding the relationships between cuisines and recipe components (e.g., ingredients, preparation time, health considerations) can reveal fascinating insights into how food connects us all. This project explores a dataset of recipes to answer one central question:

**"Can we predict the cuisine of a dish based on its ingredients and preparation details?"**

Understanding this question has implications for multiple audiences:
- **For home cooks**, it can help suggest dishes based on available ingredients.
- **For culinary enthusiasts**, it reveals patterns in global cuisines.
- **For researchers and developers**, it supports the creation of smarter recommendation systems for food-related applications.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this analysis consists of recipes, each with detailed information about their ingredients, preparation steps, health ratings, and more. It provides an excellent foundation for analyzing the components of different cuisines and predicting their classifications.

**Key statistics about the dataset**:
- **Number of rows**: *N* (where *N* is the total number of recipes).
- **Key columns relevant to the question**:
  - **`cuisine`**: The target column indicating the cuisine type (e.g., Italian, Chinese, Indian).
  - **`ingredients`**: A list of ingredients used in the recipe.
  - **`steps`**: Instructions for preparing the dish.
  - **`description`**: A short summary or note about the recipe.
  - **`health_rating`**: A numerical score reflecting the recipe's healthiness.
  - **`minutes`**: The total time required to prepare the recipe.

#### Column Descriptions
- **`cuisine`**: The main category of cuisine (e.g., Italian, Mexican, etc.), used as the target variable in the analysis.
- **`ingredients`**: A list of ingredients that form the basis for predicting cuisines.
- **`steps`**: Provides detailed preparation instructions, useful for understanding the complexity of a dish.
- **`description`**: Contains textual summaries, which can highlight the unique features of recipes from specific cuisines.
- **`health_rating`**: A numerical metric assessing the overall healthiness of the dish, ranging from 1 (least healthy) to 10 (most healthy).
- **`minutes`**: The preparation time, which can vary greatly across cuisines.
